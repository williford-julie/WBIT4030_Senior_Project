    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia awareness is something that I am passionate about.  Not only have I seen it in my clinical background but have experienced it with relatives.  The toll it takes on the caregivers is heartbreaking.  For my senior project I would like to create a website for the caregivers of Alzheimer’s and Dementia patients.  My purpose for the website is to provide education on the disease, as well as a list of local support agency resources for the caregiver to reach out for additional help.  I would also like to include nutrition tips or memory and brain engaging activities, and possibly a blog from a neurocognitive specialist or memory assessment provider.  I see this website as an opportunity to educate and remind caregivers they are not alone in this.  Many caregivers I have seen in the past are depressed or on the verge of depression and are stressed and overwhelmed.  </p>
