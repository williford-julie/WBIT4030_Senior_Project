	<p="first">	For my senior project, I developed a website titled “Caregiver, you are not alone.”  The website was created 
	with the Alzheimer’s patient caregiver in mind.  On the website, I gave basic facts on Alzheimer’s Disease signs and symptoms, 
	added stories of other caregivers or health professionals, and added a page of national and local resources.  The vision I had 
	in mind was to continuously add to the bank of resources available, with the attention on local resources.  In my opinion, many 
	caregivers do not realize there are many resources available.  Instead, the try to handle the care of their loved one alone and 
	often feel overwhelmed, frustrated, and hopeless.  On the stories page of the website, I intended to continue adding shared stories 
	to help the caregiver realize they are not the only ones in this same position.  As a matter of fact, 16 million people provide unpaid 
	caregiving to an Alzheimer’s or Memory Cognitive patient.  As time progresses, my vision is to continuously update the facts page with 
	recent research articles (in layman’s terms) in addition to more stories and updated resources.  For a future update, I would like to 
	include caregiver support group options, if available, along with more information on an adult daycare option if available in the area.</br></br>
	The website is built in HTML and CSS.  With just the basic knowledge from a previous web design class, I set out to create a website with 
	mild and relaxing colors that portrayed the information in my website vision.  Finding the right background picture took some time.  Originally, 
	I thought of a tranquil scene for the background.  I started with clouds but thought that could be taken as a “Heaven” scenery and quickly opted
	out of it.  I used royalty free images from https://www.pexels.com/royalty-free-images for most of my images on this website.  In the end, I chose 
	an image of a daisy facing up (for a hope type of feeling.)</br></br>
	After determining my header which would follow on subsequent pages, the next biggest hurdle was the main background color/image.  I started off with a blurred image that I altered with photoshop, but because my content was longer than the image, the image repeated itself and thus gave a feeling of a patchwork page.  After much experimenting, I went for a solid light blue.  I then experimented with font size and color.  This took some time because building the website in GitHub was not as responsive as building it on my own computer.  I ended up creating a duplicate website in my personal files so that I can pinpoint errors quicker and see immediate results to any changes.  Though it took longer to duplicate results, it was well worth it because I had a lot of simple errors with HTML and CSS that were mainly creator errors.   
	</br></br>
	I spent a lot of time researching websites for Alzheimer’s facts.  Though there is a lot of information on the disease, I wanted to make it generic enough that it would be easy to understand.  As a former outpatient clinic healthcare worker, I know the frustration a patient feels when a doctor tries to describe a disease process in medical terms.  For one, the patient is already overwhelmed and for another, they will not remember most of it.  So, for my facts page, I tried to break it down with brief paragraphs and bullet points for signs and symptoms.  </br></br>
	To both the home page and facts page, I added a disclaimer that is needed on any website with medical information.  On the facts page, I also added a source link to the disclaimer.
 
	Both pages have a brief video that was created with the application Doodly.  In these videos, it plays the information presented on the page.  
 
	I used this video to break up the page and add a point of interest.  The video is quick and it the music track is uplifting and upbeat.</br></br>
	The stories page was intended to be a collection of stories from both the healthcare side and the caregiver side.  This took some time due to the nature of the beast.  Asking a caregiver to jot down their feelings for a website is not an easy thing to do.  Some stories are too personal or too emotional to put down in words.  </br></br>
	The resources page was interesting to research.  Given additional time, I believe the sky is the limit.  Currently, resources on the webpage include nutrition, education, legal, and supportive resources, but given additional time, I would like to include handyman type resources along with more psychological resources.  </br></br>
	Going more in depth with HTML and CSS in this project was fascinating.  I experimented with colors, fonts, and font sizes and saw how quickly a page can change.  I also leaned one missed ending to the statement can destroy the look of a webpage quickly.  I spent a lot of time troubleshooting and wondering what I did.  For example, when creating the table for the resources page, I thought I was adding a line and ending up practically erasing the national resources section.   Or adding a “poster” to the video line, and then the video would not play.  I loved experimenting with the HTML and CSS format and reading different resources on page design.  Keeping my colors of the webpages consistent was one tip I read from reading up on design.  I also found resources on HTML color codes and experimented with many different colors before landing on #E0EDF9 as my background color.  For my project, I also purchased Doodly, an application used to create doodle videos.  I had seen videos like these in demonstrations in t	he past and always thought they were interesting.   Learning how to create these videos was not hard but was a little time consuming.  I believe it can create an interesting feature on the webpage though and was worth the extra effort.  </br></br>
	Even though I have taken a class in web design in the past, having the creative ability to design my own website with my own project/idea has been a great learning experience.  I did not have a guide or instructions to draw from so each step felt like I needed extra “courage”.  I enjoyed the experimentation with design and colors to get the look and feel I wanted to portray in my vison for this website.  I wanted to create something that I was passionate about, and Alzheimer’s Disease hits close to home for me.  Learning HTML and CSS is not just something I will use only in this project, but something I can take with me and use in my work.  As a support analyst for a few Electronic Health Record applications for our health system, I often must create custom forms.  Our custom forms are often created with HTML and CSS.  Having this knowledge and experience can help me create healthcare forms that are not only functional, but also have easier readability.  </br></br>
